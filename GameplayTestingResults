    - **Review:** Game overall was about average. Getting the bad parts out of the way, the controls were not intuitive and hard to manage. The keybinds are not orthodox, and rebinding keys is not allowed. Movement is hard, as it moves the player too far and does not allow for minute adjustments. In terms of aesthetic, the game looks pleasing enough with fitting music and sound effects as well. The design of the level is good and tries to test different skills from the player, but in reality does not allow for much skill expression due to poorly implemented movement/abilities. The aggro range of the mobs is far too low and makes the ranged weapon too powerful, and the invincibility/frequency of the dash makes it the only viable way to traverse the level. Boss fight was pog. Would have enjoyed a more thematic transition into the boss room instead of suddenly appearing in the room. Number of bugs that did not take too much from the overall experience, but would be nice if fixed (getting stuck in terrain, mobs glitching out).

    - **Review:** While opening the game for the first time I could tell that this would either be extremely difficult to complete or hard to progress. The keys were fairly easy to understand , arrow keys or WASD to move, left click to attack etc, but to my suprise there were other attacking mechanics that seemed more enjoyable to use like the fireball or Explosion fart with the S key. This platformer felt very easy to traverse the map after a couple tries and the use of the dash ability to get through parts of the level. After going through majority of the level listening to the same soundtrack over and over I believe I started to go slightly insane as the repetition could be felt as I continuiously died before beating the level. The game itself presents itself as any platformer using obstacles and enviroment to obstruct the player and have them navigate through them to reach the goal. While going through this I noticed one bug where I would slip between the cracks of the enviroment or block and become stuck until I wiggle my character out spamming the keys. The monsters in game were also very lack luster but did their job in being annoying to get past or ignore.

    - **Review:** My Ruined Isle adventure was overall a average experience. The good parts about the game were intuitive menu layout, pleasurable graphics, well thought out map design, and a decent combat system with timing your dashes. The flip side of the combat system also starts off the bad parts of the game. The combat currently doesn't properly make use of all of your abilities, and with the current dash in the game allows you to skip and ignore all combat. The movement at first is extremely sloppy with increased momentum on double jump which allowed a lot of sliding on blocks when landing. Most enemies in the game can be killed with ranged attacks which they do not react to.
    - **Additional points** *(during gameplay)*:
        - "Please make a control menu to tell me the abilities in advance."
        - “The speed difference between just jumping normally but then double jumping is way too big. It’s not realistic. ...Why am I so fast?”
        - “The mobs should really at least aggro you if they take damage from you. You can just cheese the mobs by shooting projectiles out of range.”

    - **Quote:** "The down smash seems too weak compared to all the other abilities."
    - **General Points:** 
        - Disliked the movement controls but also found it entertaining to overcome.
        - Noticed the player and enemy sometimes glitches into the background trees.
        - Thought the abilities were cool in theory, but in reality, you only need the dashing to get through the platforming. Interesting in seeing how the boss battle unfolds and hopefully allows for better display of skill.
        - Enemies aggro range too small, making them easy to ignore.

    - **Quote:** "Overall, it was a bit entertaining having to learn how to manage the really hard controls. But I still think it should be changed."
    - **General Points:** 
        - The sound is a bit delayed when the player drowns.
        - Sometimes the skeleton will teleport.
      - Encountered a bug where the player was about to fall into water, but spammed dash into the wall and wall climbed back up, saving his run.
      - No reason to use down smash.

    - **Quote:** "I'm not a platforming god by any means, but I've played platformers before and it's usually not this bad..."
    - **General Points:** 
        - The movement is way too fast. Observed that the one left or right move corresponds to more than a block of movement and suggested it be halved.
        - Quit 5 minutes into gameplay due to hard controls. On top of the movement being too fast, also disliked that the jump was on W and UP. Suggested the dash be changed to be a double-tap A or D control instead.

    - Likes: Music, graphics are cute, some animations feel smooth 
    - Dislikes: Jumping is hard, enemies don't aggro so it feels weird
