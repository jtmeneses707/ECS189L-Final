                <h2>Synposis: </h2>
                <p>Overcoming your inhibitions is difficult for anyone, especially for those who have already given up
                    hope on themselves. An unemployed video game addict, Urumir spends his days browsing online forums
                    and replaying the same old games. His days are bleak and dreary, until one day when he makes his
                    daily trip to the local convenience store.
                </p>
                <p>There he meets an untimely end against a speeding Subaru,
                    passing away instantly, his trusty tracksuit failing to protect him. The next thing he knows is
                    opening his eyes in an entirely new world - His body no longer the same, instead composed as an
                    adorable slime. Confused, alone, scared, he tentatively explored the new lands around him, and found
                    a warm welcome from the people of the Isles. In their care he finds the know-how and support he
                    needs to survive in an unfamiliar world. </p>
                <p>With newfound confidence and desire for exploration, Urumir
                    ventured out farther and farther into the world, accumulating new experiences and abilities,
                    realizing how much time he wasted in his previous life. On and on for years he went, until finally,
                    satisfied he saw all there was to see, Urumir began the journey home to the place he first woke. But
                    there he is met with a bleak sight. Alletas the Demon King had ravaged the Isles, razing down entire
                    villages and towns. With his loved ones mercilessly slaughtered and his home destroyed, Urumir's
                    story takes a drastic shift. He looks to redeem the wasted years wallowed away on nothing, fully
                    coming into his own as a man of valor and honor. To avenge his friends, he must cleanse the land of
                    demonic creatures and strike the Demon King Atellas down from his throne.</p>
                <h2>Gameplay: </h2>
                <p> We wanted our game to be a skill based 2D platformer, taking heavy inspiration from games
                    like Celeste and Castlevania. To complete your goal of defeating Demon King Atellas, you must
                    skillfully
                    traverse the level, avoiding obstacles and defeating minions along the way. To aid you in your
                    quest, Urumir is equipped with various special abilities. </p>
