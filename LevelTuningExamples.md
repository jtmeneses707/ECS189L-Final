## Level Fine-Tuning Examples #

Playtesters and developers both had a consistent death rate in this area, so the platform was extended, making it easier to land on without colliding with the fire.

Skeletons ended up being much taller than the player sprite and would either glitch underneath the tiles or get stuck on the tiles while trying to chase the player, making this sequence a bit too easy. The platforms were raised for all areas with skeletons in the sequence so they may properly chase the player.

This particular double jump dash challenge ended up being tough for many players and would result in death by burning, or falling into the pit, so extra platforms were put in.

During testing, I realized that if a player was in the slime form when reaching this area and all prior enemies have died, they would be unable to progress forward as they no longer have their dash ability, so one of the fire pits were removed to let the slime player keep progressing.
